# Agent Directory Template Documentation

**Important Note**: This project is not affiliated with the official A2A protocol. It's a sample implementation of an agent directory template that uses A2A protocol standards for documentation purposes.

## What Is This Project?

The Agent Directory is a **Git-based template** for creating an internal inventory of AI agents that follow the A2A protocol. It's designed for **human discoverability and documentation**, not for machine-to-machine agent discovery within the A2A protocol itself.

This template helps you:

- **Document your agents** in a centralized location
- **Track capabilities and skills** of each agent
- **Maintain URLs and endpoints** where agents are accessible
- **Document security requirements** and configurations
- **Create a searchable interface** for your team

## About A2A Protocol

The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol enables AI agents to interact across systems and frameworks. This template uses A2A's JSON schema for documentation purposes.
